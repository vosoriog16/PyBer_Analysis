# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:

# The purpose of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to May 2019 for Pyber using Python, Matplotlib and pandas. This analysis will compare the Urban, Rural and Suburban city types and determine their differences. This analysis will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

# Results:

For this analysis to be completed, the city types used were Rural, Urban and Suburban. In the chart Ride Sharing Data for all three citty types, it shows that for rural there are more riders than drivers, for suburban its the same, as for urban ther are more drivers than riders. As for the average fares per ride, it is lower for urban cities than rural or suburban. The total fare over the months ranging from January to April for Urban cities is greater in comparison to Rural and Suburban cities. This is shown in the Total Fare by city Type graph. There is a lot of fluctuation going from week to week within each month, the causes for these variations are unknown. This is something that should be more thoroguhly researched in order raise the rates by city types. 


# Summary:

# Recommendations:

As the graph for Total Fares by City Type demonstrates, the most revenue comes from urban rides. You can see the fares decrease in the beginning of March for all three city types but increase by a small amount when reaching the month of April; the causes for this slight increse can vary due to weather, break from school/work and people going out more rather than staying in. In order for Pyber to have a more steady increase, it would be recommended to uptake better marketting plans to make the public more aware of their service. As the graph shows, rural and suburban areas dont receive as many fares by month as urban areas do. This is due to the lack of drivers that there are in these areas, we may have the riders, but not the drivers. It is possible to increase revenue, that better incentives and benefits would make as good marketing for hiring drivers. Pyber may not be reaching many areas in certain neighborhoods, mainly due to lack of proper marketing. Pyber should invest in btter marketing for neighborhoods that show low fares. Also, there is not much information on drivers and the costs that come with driving such as gas. There needs to be a more accurate representation of all the costs that drivers may encounter and the problems riders may have, specifically for rural areas.
